## Anchr.io for Chrome extension released
December 03, 2015

I have released a Chrome extension to directly interact with [Anchr.io](https://anchr.io "Anchr.io")â€˜s shortlink- and bookmark functionality right from your browser and without even having to visit the website. Shortening a link on any webpage is just three clicks away, adding one to you bookmark collection only two. Check it out and give it a try: [https://anchr.io/s/tzYcr](https://anchr.io/s/tzYcr "https://anchr.io/s/tzYcr")
