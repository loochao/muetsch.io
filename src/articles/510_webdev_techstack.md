## Web Development Technology Stack
March 15, 2016

I tried to give a comprehensive overview of all important and fashionable technologies concerning web- and cross-platform development, so I created kind of a mind map outlining relevant technologies in terms of languages, frameworks, libraries, webservices and tools. I consider them kind of must-haves for JavaScript fullstack web-developers. You might have already heard of most of them and probably you have even worked with the majority.
