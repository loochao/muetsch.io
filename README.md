This website is built completely from scratch and focuses on simplicity and efficiency. Consequently it doesn't contain scripts. The entire page is optimized to be as small as possible and is served via HTTP/2.0 and gzip compression for additional speed. It doesn't rely on a backend or database. Instead, I've set up a custom build system using Node.js and NPM scripts to compile, process and bundle, Pug templates and Markdown files down to static HTML. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/n1try/ferdinand-muetsch.de).
