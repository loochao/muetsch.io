# About

Hey, welcome and thank you for visiting my webpage! My name is Ferdinand MÃ¼tsch, I am 24 years old and living in Karlsruhe, Germany. I am studying [information engineering and management](http://informationswirtschaft.org), which basically is a mixture of 40 % computer science, 40 % economics and 20 % law â€“ at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](http://kit.edu). Currently, I am in the fourth Master's semester after having finished my Bachelor's thesis at [TECO](http://teco.edu) in 2016 and about to graduate as a Master Of Science in 2019.

My interests are â€“ among others â€“ software development, especially in a web- and mobile context, as well as data science and machine leatning. I consider myself very open-minded and progressive and I am continuously interested in new technology.

Besides my studies I used to work as a student employee at [Inovex](http://inovex.de) (great company! ðŸ˜‰) in Karlsruhe and as a self-employed Freelancer developer. Currently, I am doing an internship at [VW ERL](http://vwlerl.com) in Belmont, CA in the software platforms. Accordingly, I have participated in realizing software projects for small and mid-sized businesses in the context of Industry 4.0, customer data analytics, corporate intranet solutions and customer self-service platforms.
