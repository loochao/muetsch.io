# About

## My Person

Hey, welcome and thank you for visiting my webpage.

My name is Ferdinand Mütsch, I am 25 years old, living in Karlsruhe, Germany and close to finishing my studies on [information engineering and management](https://informationswirtschaft.org) at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://kit.edu).

Currently, I am working in my Master's thesis at [ITIV](https://itiv.kit.edu) on the subjects of _Cooperative Perception and Cellular Vehicle-2-X Communication for Autonomous Driving_. Prior to this, I got my Bachelor's degree in 2016 with a final thesis about _Microservices and Semantic Web_ at [TECO](https://teco.edu).

My interests are – among others – software development, especially in a web- and mobile context, as well as data science and machine leatning. I consider myself very open-minded and progressive and I am continuously interested in new technology.

Besides my studies I used to work as a student employee at [Inovex](https://inovex.de) in Karlsruhe and as a self-employed Freelancer developer. In addition, I did a rewarding internship at the [Volkswagen Electronic Research Lab (ERL)](https://vwiecc.com/) in Belmont, California as part of the software platforms team.
I participated in realizing software projects for small and mid-sized businesses in the context of Industry 4.0, the Internet of Things, big-scale data analytics, web platforms and more.
