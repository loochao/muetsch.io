# About

Hey, welcome and thank you for visiting my webpage! My name is Ferdinand Mütsch,  a’m 23 years young and currently living in Karlsruhe, Germany. I am studying [information engineering and management](http://informationswirtschaft.org), which basically is a mixture of 40 % computer science, 40 % economics and 20 % law – at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](http://kit.edu). Currently, I am in the fourth Master's semester after having finished my Bachelor's thesis at [TECO](http://teco.edu) in 2016 and about to graduate as a Master Of Science by the end of 2018.

My interests are – among others – software development, especially in a web- and mobile context as well as IT operations. I consider myself pretty open-minded and I am continuously interested in new technology. Currently I am deepening on the subjects of Data Mining and Machine Learning.

Besides my studies I am working as a student employee at [Inovex](http://inovex.de) in Karlsruhe and as a self-employed **Freelancer developer**. Accordingly, I have participated in realizing software projects for small and mid-sized businesses in the context of Industry 4.0, customer data analytics, corporate intranet solutions and customer self-service platforms. If you are curious about my projects as a Freelancer or interested in working with me please feel free to contact me!
