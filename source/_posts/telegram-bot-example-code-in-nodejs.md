As a response to my [latest article](how-to-make-telegram-bots.html) on how to make Telegram bots, I got many requests from guys who had problems with actually getting such a bot set up with my tutorial and they asked for a complete, working code example. So I made one. It is limited to the very basics, but it works and may serve as inspiration for you. What most of you would probably like to have further in your bots, but what is not covered in my example, is a database connection. Because in most cases your bot will probably need to persist data. To realize this you should have a little rather advanced skills in Node as well as basic knowledge of the database system of your choice, which is MongoDB with Mongoose Node module for me.

Alright, hereâ€™s my sample bot: [http://github.com/muety/telegram-bot-node-sample](http://github.com/muety/telegram-bot-node-sample/)
